    "1. KNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm. It works by finding the \"k\" closest data points (neighbors) to a given input and makes a predictions based on the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression).\n",
    "2. K-Nearest Neighbors is also called as a lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the entire dataset and performs computations only at the time of classification\n",
